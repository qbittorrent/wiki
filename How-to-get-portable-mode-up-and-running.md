# For version v4.2.1 and above.

This is just a brief instruction as to how to get qBittorrent running in portable mode.

**Windows only**
1. Download the latest version of qB that supports the profile folder method which is **v4.2.1**.
2. Extract the `qbittorrent_x.x.x_xxx_setup.exe` file to any location on your PC using 7zip or any other applicable program.
3. Create a folder called `profile` in the same directory as the extracted `qbittorrent.exe` file.
4. Click on `qbittorrent.exe` and it will create the needed files required within `profile` folder to enable portable mode.
5. **Done.**
6. **Optional**: If you have a previous install of the program on your hard drive then copy all the relevant files to the matching directories inside the `profile` folder.

    **These two folders are the ones in question:**

    `C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\qBittorrent`

    `C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Local\qBittorrent`
