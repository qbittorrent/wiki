# Do You Have Speed Problems?

If so, please do not ask for assistance here, go to the [Official qBittorrent support forum](http://forum.qbittorrent.org) and provide the answers to the following:

## Connection Speed
What your ISP has sold you is irrelevant, to calculate a starting place for settings requires a real time check of bandwidth/speed capability.

### Instructions

Turn off any and all BitTorrent clients that are running, open [Speedtest.net](http://www.speedtest.net)  in a browser, run the test(s), then provide a screen shot of the results in your post.

## Version and Operating System

This is essential. Also before asking, please ensure that you are using the latest release for your OS. See the [news page](https://www.qbittorrent.org/news.php) first, as we do not support older versions of qBittorrent.

If a specific loaded task is a problem, please provide:

If providing screen shots for any of the above, **please** hide the name column or obfuscate the name and/or hash id of the task along with 'access keys' in 'private' tracker URIs
