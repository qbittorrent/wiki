# Information

**Note:** issues with alternate WebAPI clients should be reported in their respective repositories.

A non-exhaustive list of alternate **non** Web-based FOSS WebAPI clients developed for qBittorrent by the community. They are provided on a best-effort basis as a community initiative and not officially supported. Some of them might be might implement the full API, while others might not. Not to be confused with alternate WebUIs, which are just alternate Web-based WebAPI clients.

If you know of more, feel free to add a link to the repository along with a short description.
