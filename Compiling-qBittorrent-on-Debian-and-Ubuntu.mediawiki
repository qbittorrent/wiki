Only follow this guide if you know what you are doing and this is what you really want.<br />
If you are looking only for the latest version of qBittorrent, just head to the [https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php download page] and use our [https://launchpad.net/~qbittorrent-team/+archive/ubuntu/qbittorrent-stable PPAs].

This how-to will guide you though the compilation of qBittorrent and libtorrent-rasterbar.<br />
This guide is written for Debian/Ubuntu, but the process should be similar for other Debian-derivatives distributions.

== Required dependencies ==
* General required dependencies
 sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config automake libtool git zlib1g-dev
 sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-random-dev libssl-dev libgeoip-dev

* Qt libraries
qBittorrent 4.0 - 4.1.x requires at least Qt 5.5.1, and qBittorrent 4.2 and later requires at least Qt 5.9.<br /><br />

Note that Qt libraries in Debian 8/9 repository is too old for compiling newer qBittorrent, you need to upgrade your system to Debian 10, or install newer Qt libraries by the other way.<br />

If you were using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, you could add this PPA:
 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:beineri/opt-qt597-xenial
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install qt59base qt59svg qt59tools
 export PATH=/opt/qt59/bin:$PATH
 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/qt59/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

For Debian 10, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or later, just install Qt from repository
 sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libqt5svg5-dev


* Python (Run time only dependency, for the search engine)
 sudo apt-get install python3

== Libtorrent ==
[https://libtorrent.org/ Libtorrent] is a library written by Arvid Norberg that qBittorrent depends on.<br />
It is necessary to compile and install libtorrent before compiling qBittorrent.

Install Libtorrent dev pkg from repository
 sudo apt-get install libtorrent-rasterbar-dev

or use git repo and compile Libtorrent yourself.

Clone from the repo
 git clone https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent.git
 cd libtorrent

Choose the appropriate <code>git</code> and compile command according to the version of libtorrent you need:

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Unix Makefiles" ../..</source>
|-
| 1.0.*
| <= 4.1.5
| <source>git checkout RC_1_0</source>
| <source>./autotool.sh
./configure --disable-debug --enable-encryption</source>
| <source>mkdir -p cmake-build-dir/release && cd cmake-build-dir/release
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "Unix Makefiles" ../..</source>
|}

(*)If you get a <code>configure: error: Boost.System library not found</code>, check if you installed all the above dependencies.<br/>
If yes, add <code>--with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu</code>

Now you're ready to compile:
 make clean && make -j$(nproc)
 sudo make install

See note in the next section regarding the build jobs.

For more information on building libtorrent, see [https://www.libtorrent.org/building.html libtorrent downloading and building].

== Compiling qBittorrent (with the GUI) ==
First, obtain the qBittorrent source code.<br />
Either download and extract a .tar archive from [https://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/qbittorrent/ Sourceforge] or clone the git repository:
  git clone https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent

If you clone the git repository and want to use the stable current version (rather than the development version which may not work), you need to checkout the stable branch. You can do this in two ways:

By checking out the stable branch (4.1.x at the time of writing):

  cd qBittorrent
  git checkout v4_1_x

Or by checking out the latest tagged stable release (4.1.5 at the time of writing):

  cd qBittorrent
  git checkout release-4.1.5

Enter the folder in a new terminal window and run:
 ./configure
 make -j$(nproc)

* Note 1: If you're using libtorrent-rasterbar from the 0.16.x series, you also need to pass the <code>--with-libtorrent-rasterbar0.16</code> option to configure. qBittorrent v3.3.x has dropped the support of libtorrent 0.16.x.
* Note 2: If you want to compile with qt4 instead of qt5, you also need to pass the <code>--with-qt4</code> option to configure. qBittorrent v4.0.x has dropped the support of qt4
* Note 3: This build uses a conservative number of jobs (equal to the threads available); increasing it may make the build faster, but an eye must be kept on the memory usage.

Finally, you can install qBittorrent:

If you have <code>checkinstall</code>, the following command will generate and install a <code>.deb</code> package that can be tracked and managed by your package manager:

 sudo checkinstall --nodoc --pkgname qbittorrent --pkgversion 4.2.1-source-compile # change this to your liking

Alternatively, the traditional way will do just fine:

 sudo make install

That's it! qBittorrent should now be installed. You can now run qBittorrent using the following command:
 qbittorrent

== Compiling qBittorrent (without the GUI; aka qBittorrent-nox aka headless) ==
First, obtain the qBittorrent source code.<br />
Either download and extract a .tar archive from [https://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/qbittorrent/ Sourceforge] or clone the git repository:
  git clone https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent
  cd qBittorrent
If you clone the git repository and want to use the stable current version (rather than the development version), you need to checkout the stable branch. 
 git checkout v4_1_x
(Note: When the stable version changes to 4.2.0, the stable branch will change to v4_2_x.)

Enter the folder in a new terminal window and run:
 ./configure --disable-gui CXXFLAGS="-std=c++14"
 make -j$(nproc)

* Note 1: If you're using libtorrent-rasterbar from the 0.16.x series, you also need to pass the <code>--with-libtorrent-rasterbar0.16</code> option to configure. qBittorrent v3.3.x has dropped the support of libtorrent 0.16.x.
* Note 2: If you want to compile with qt4 instead of qt5, you also need to pass the <code>--with-qt4</code> option to configure. qBittorrent v4.0.x has dropped the support of qt4
* Note 3: This build uses a conservative number of jobs (equal to the threads available); increasing it may make the build faster, but an eye must be kept on the memory usage.

Finally, you can install qBittorrent:

If you have <code>checkinstall</code>, the following command will generate and install a <code>.deb</code> package that can be tracked and managed by your package manager:

 sudo checkinstall --nodoc --pkgname qbittorrent-nox --pkgversion 4.2.1-source-compile # change the version to your liking

Alternatively, the traditional method will do just fine:

 sudo make install

If everything went fine, there is one last thing you need to do, just simply run:
 ldconfig
The following method is too complex, but if you want to know what's going on, then you can read the following method (see https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/8047):

Check if your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable is set and the path <code>/usr/local/lib</code> is included.

Simply run <code>env</code> in your terminal and look for <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.
If so, you are good to go. If not, add the path to the variable:
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

That's it! qBittorrent-nox should now be installed. You can now run qBittorrent-nox using the following command:
 qbittorrent-nox

Since you disabled the graphical user interface, qBittorrent can only be controlled via its WebUI. If you haven't disabled authentication, as a default, you can access it at:
 http://localhost:8080
 Username: admin
 Password: adminadmin

A documentation about running qBittorrent without GUI is available [[Running-qBittorrent-without-X-server|here]].
