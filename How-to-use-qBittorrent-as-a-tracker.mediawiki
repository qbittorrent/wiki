Since qBittorrent v2.5.0, qBittorrent ships a fully-functional tracker that allows you to share files with your friends way more easily.

=== Enable the embedded tracker ===
qBittorrent's embedded tracker is disabled as a default to save resources. If you wish to use it, you need to enable it in the advanced preferences panel.

As a default, the tracker URL is:<br />
 http://your_public_ip:9000/announce

=== Forward the tracker port on your router ===
If you want your tracker to be accessible from Internet (i.e. outside your LAN), you will probably have to configure your router to forward the tracker port to your machine (default: <code>9000</code>).

Once you have configure your router, you can test that your configuration is working by:
# Running qBittorrent
# Enabling the embedded tracker
# Go to [[http://www.canyouseeme.org/]]:
## Type in your tracker port (e.g. <code>9000</code>)
## Press the "Check" button
# You should get a position result or this means that your router is not properly configured.

=== How to share files with my friends using qBittorrent? ===

# Enable the embedded tracker in advanced preferences
# Run the "Torrent creation tool" in qBittorrent
# Select the local files you wish to share
# Type in the URL of your local tracker in the tracker list (<code>http://your_public_ip:9000/announce</code>)
## You can check [[http://www.whatsmyip.org/]] to know your public IP address
# Check the "Start seeding after creation" box
# Press the "Create and save..." button
## Save the torrent file wherever you like
# Send this newly created .torrent file to your friends and they will be able the download the files you are sharing using any Bittorrent client.

=== If you are using qBittorrent without X ===
Stop qBittorrent and add the following lines to ''~/.config/qBittorrent/qBittorrent.conf'':
 Advanced\trackerEnabled=true
 Advanced\trackerPort=9000
under the <code>[Preferences]</code> section.
