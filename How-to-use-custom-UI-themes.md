# Introduction

As of version 4.2.2, custom unofficial Qt UI themes can be used on all platforms. This is mostly relevant for Windows users, because on Windows there is currently no native themeing integration.

# Procedure

You can find some unofficial themes here: [List of unofficial themes](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/List-of-known-qBittorrent-themes)

After you have downloaded your chosen `.qbtheme` theme file, using it is quite easy:

1. Enable `Menu->Tools->Options->Behavior->Interface->Use custom UI Theme` and select the `.qbtheme` file
2. Restart QBittorrent for the `.qbtheme` to take effect.
