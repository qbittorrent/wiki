Here you will find explanation for various settings found under the options in qBittorrent, grouped by the tab. The options can be accessed by hitting '''Alt''' + '''O''' or going to ''Tools'' and clicking on ''Options''. Some of these options are pretty self explanatory, so detailed explanations for these have been omitted. For additional clarification or explanation, please visit the [http://forum.qbittorrent.org qBittorrent forum].

= Behavior =

== Language ==
This is used to set the language qBittorrent uses in it's GUI (Graphical User Interface). If you want to provide another language, or update an already existing one, you may do so through Transifex. [https://qbforums.shiki.hu/index.php/topic,2134.0.html Here] is the corresponding forum topic.

== Transfer lists ==
*'''Use alternating row colors''' - using alternating row colors makes it easier for the human eye to read lists from a short distance. It is enabled by default, disable it if you choose.

*'''Action on double click''' - You can also customize the actions that are triggered upon double clicking with the mouse.

== Desktop ==

*'''Start qBittorrent on Windows start up''' - specifies whether or not you want to start qBittorrent when you start up your Windows PC. Disabled by default.
*'''Show splash screen on start up''' - specifies whether the screen containing the qBittorrent logo along with the current version number should be shown whenever the program is started. Enabled by default.
*'''Start qBittorrent minimized''' - this specifies whether, when you start qBittorrent, you want it to be minimized to the taskbar or not. Disabled by default.
*'''Ask for program exit confirmation''' - if you try to close qBittorrent when there are active torrents, it will display a warning stating the same. Enabled by default.
*'''Show qBittorrent in notification area''' - choose whether you want qBittorrent to be shown in the notification area along with other system icons. There are also two additional options -

**'''Minimize qBittorrent to notification area''' minimizes qB to the notification area and
**'''Close qBittorrent to notification area''' results in qB moving to the notification area upon closing (similar to µTorrent).

*'''File association''' allows you to select or deselect qBittorrent as the default application for opening torrent files and/or magnet links. This is asked upon installation, after which the options can be changed here.

**'''Use qBittorrent for .torrent files''' allows qBittorrent to associate itself whenever you open a .torrent file. This setting can be also adjusted via the system settings, ''Set default programs'' in Windows 7 and earlier, or ''Choose default apps by file type'' in Windows 8 and later.
**'''Use qBittorrent for magnet links''' allows qBittorrent to pop up whenever you click on a magnet link. This setting can also be adjusted in the browser.


== Power Management ==
This allows you to prevent the system from going into sleep mode when torrents are active. Useful if you do not want to change sleep settings for your system, but still don't want it to go into sleep mode when qBittorrent is up and running.

= Downloads =

== When adding a torrent ==
* '''Display the torrent content and some options''' - this enables qBittorrent to allow you to configure the save location, specifying whether to start the torrent immediately, skip the hash check, to select the label, and to select the content to download and assign priorities.
** '''Bring torrent dialog to the front''' does what it says. It brings the torrent dialog to focus.
* '''Do not start the download automatically''' allows you the option of either starting the download without delay, or to wait for the user to click on the Start button.

== Hard Disk ==
* '''Save files to location''' allows you to select your default save locations.
** '''Append the label of the torrent to the save path''' - if you want to append the labels of your torrent to the save path (click here if you want to know what labels are and how to use them), you can choose to do so.
* '''Pre-allocate disk space for all files''' - this option allows qBittorrent to allocate (that is, assign) space on your hard disk (or SSD) so that the problem of not having enough space does not arise later on.
** '''Keep incomplete torrents in''' - if you wish to save your incomplete torrents to a temporary folder, before they are moved to another folder upon completion, use this option.
* '''Append .!qb extension to incomplete files''' - this option is similar to µTorrent's appending of .ut to incomplete files. What this option does is that, to enable you to identify files that have not yet been downloaded fully, it adds a .!qb extension to these files. So, ''Hello.mp3'' will be stored as ''Hello.!qb'' until the download is complete, after which it gets renamed to ''Hello.mp3''.
* '''Automatically add torrent from''' option allows qBittorrent to automatically load torrents from specific folders to be downloaded to another set of specific folders.
* '''Copy .torrent files to''' option allows you to copy .torrent files for the torrents that you download to a specific folder (for example, ''Downloaded torrents'').
* '''Copy .torrent files for finished downloads to''' option is the same as the above, with one difference. Only for completed torrents will qBittorrent copy the .torrent file to the specified location.

== Email notification upon completion of downloads ==
This allows you to receive an email when your download finishes. For this, you will have to supply the fields required.

== Run an external program on torrent completion ==
This allows you to run a program on finishing certain types of torrents in a certain location.

= Connection =

== Listening Port ==
* '''Port used for incoming connections''' - either specify the [https://whatismyipaddress.com/port port] or choose a random one.
* '''Use UPnP/ NAT-PMP port forwarding from my router''' - for a helpful introduction to port forwarding, go [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding here], or [https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-port-forwarding-2483494 here].
* '''Use different port on each startup''' voids the first option, and randomly assigns a different port every time qBittorrent starts up.

== Connection Limits ==
* '''Global maximum number of connections''' sets the maximum number of peers to connect to for ''all'' torrents.
* '''Maximum number of connections per torrent''' sets the maximum number of peers to connect to for ''each'' torrent.
* '''Global maximum number of upload slots''' sets the maximum number of [http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Max_upload_slots_per_torrent upload slots] (basically the number of peers you connect to) for ''all'' torrents.
* '''Maximum number of upload slots''' sets the maximum of upload slots for ''each'' torrent.
== Proxy server ==
These options allow you to set up a proxy server to use when downloading torrents. A tutorial of sorts can be accessed [https://kickass.to/community/show/41088/ here] (for µTorrent, but can be used for qBittorrent as well).

Disable connections not supported by proxies: [[Disable-connections-not-supported-by-proxies|link]]

== IP filtering ==
This is a feature which allows you to block certain ''bad peers''. Didn't understand a word? More information about that [http://www.techzilo.com/ban-utorrent-peers-ip-address/ here].

= Speed =

== Global Rate Limits ==
You can use this to set global (for all torrents) rate limits for both downloads and uploads. For the other options, read [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Transport_Protocol this]  Wikipedia article.

== Alternative Global Rate Limits ==
For those of you whose internet connectivity is limited during specific hours (for example, you might have unlimited bandwidth during the night, but limited during the day), this option is for you. You can schedule these to be activated automatically, or manually activate it using the bottom tool bar in qBittorrent.

= BitTorrent =

== Privacy ==
* '''Enable DHT (decentralized network) to find more peers'''  - DHT is a solution to make torrent downloading and uploading a tracker independent operation. More about DHT [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_%28protocol%29#Creating_and_publishing_torrents here].
** '''Use a different port for DHT and BitTorrent''' allows the port that DHT and BitTorrent use to be different.
* '''Enable Peer Exchange (PeX) to find more peers''' - another alternative to enable lesser dependency on trackers. More information [http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Peer_Exchange here].
* '''Enable Local Peer Discovery to find more peers''' - an extension to the BitTorrent protocol to enable communication via LAN. More information [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Peer_Discovery here].
* '''Enable anonymous mode''' - in simple terms, qBittorrent tries to maintain a certain degree of anonymity while using this function. Detailed explanation [[Anonymous-Mode|here]].

== Torrent Queuing ==
These options allow you to control the number of torrents being downloaded and uploaded. Refer to the documentation [https://www.libtorrent.org/single-page-ref.html#queuing here] for information on ''slow torrents''.

== Share Ratio Limiting ==
Here, you can configure to what ratio (amount uploaded/amount downloaded) the torrent should be seeded. You can also configure on whether you want them to be paused or removed after this.

= Web UI =
You can use a remote control with qBittorrent. For more information, go [https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki#webui-related here].

= Advanced =

The following settings are also documented in qBittorrent and libtorrent, respectively [https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/blob/master/src/gui/advancedsettings.cpp here] and [https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/blob/master/include/libtorrent/settings_pack.hpp here].

=== qBittorrent–specific configuration ===
* '''Network interface''' — specifies which network interfaces qBittorrent listens on. On multi-nic systems (e.g. device has an ethernet port and wifi) you may limit which interface should be used to send and transmit data.
* '''Optional IP address to bind to''' — ''TBA''
* '''Listen on IPv6 address''' — allows qBittorrent to listen on IPv6 address in addition to the old, standard IPv4.
* '''Save resume data interval''' — duration on which the resume data is saved to the disk. (''TBA'': What is "resume data")
* '''Confirm torrent recheck''' — before manually rechecking torrents (e.g. Context-menu → Force recheck), a user confirmation dialog is displayed.
* '''Recheck torrents on completion''' — after the torrent is completely downloaded a recheck operation is performed on the torrent. (''TBA'': completing may or may not be before ''seeding'' completion.)  This is specially useful on unreliable disks or filesystems.
* '''Check for software updates''' — allows qBittorrent to check for new versions released on GitHub.  If a new version is found, user is asked to update qBittorrent.
* '''Transfer list refresh interval''' — controls how fast or slow the transfer list view is updated.  Adjusting the refresh interval to a lower value displays less accurate speeds in average, but nicer results.  If qBittorrent is running in the background, you may increase the value instead.  Using lower values might cause qBittorrent to use more resources. The default value is `1500 ms` (i.e. 1.5 seconds).
* '''Resolve peer host name''' — when enabled, the address list in the Peers tab will try to resolve IP addresses to hostname using reverse lookups. Might not always return accurate results.
* '''Resolve peer countries using GeoIP''' — when enabled, qBittorrent tries to lookup the originating country of each peer using GeoIP database.
* '''Display notifications''' — will make qBittorrent output system tray notifications for various events (e.g. download completed, search finished, an error occurred).  Disabling this option will silence qBittorrent.
* '''Display notifications for added torrents''' — when enabled will make qBittorrent output new notification on adding a new torrent.  Specially useful if torrents are added using RSS or the Web UI.
* '''Confirm removal of all tags''' — displays a user confirmation message before removing all tags.
* '''Download tracker's favicon''' — when enabled, qBittorrent tries to fetch the "favicon.ico" file from each tracker URL.  This icon is displayed in the left pane under "Trackers" in GUI.
* '''Save path history length''' — this controls how many recent paths qBittorrent will remember.

=== libtorrent–specific configuration ===
A complete list of libtorrent configuration may be found [https://www.libtorrent.org/reference-Settings.html#guided_read_cache here].
* '''Asynchronous I/O threads''' — ''TBA''
* '''Disk cache''' — amount of data that will remain in RAM before being written to disk.  If set to `0`, no data will be kept in RAM and instead it will be immediately written to disk (you might see performance impact.)
* '''Disk cache expiry interval''' — is the number of seconds from the last cached write to a piece in the write cache, to when it's forcefully flushed to disk.  Default: `60 seconds`.
* '''Enable OS cache''' — ''TBA''
* '''Guided read cache''' —  enables the disk cache to adjust the size of a cache line generated by peers to depend on the upload rate you are sending to that peer.  The intention is to optimize the RAM usage of the cache, to read ahead further for peers that you're sending faster to.
* '''Coalesce reads & writes''' — allocate separate, contiguous, buffers for read and write calls.  Only used where writev/readv cannot be used, and will use more RAM but may improve performance.
* '''Send upload piece suggestions''' — controls whether or not libtorrent will send out suggest messages to create a bias of its peers to request certain pieces.  If enabled, libtorrent will send out suggest messages for the most recent pieces that are in the read cache.
* '''Send buffer watermark''' — ''TBA''
* '''Send buffer low watermark''' — ''TBA''
* '''Maximum number of half-open connections''' —  sets the maximum number of half-open connections libtorrent will have when connecting to peers.  A half-open connection is one where connect() has been called, but the connection still hasn't been established (nor failed).
* '''Outgoing ports''' — ''TBA''
* '''µTP-TCP mixed mode algorithm''' — determines how to treat TCP connections when there are uTP connections.  Since uTP is designed to yield to TCP, there's an inherent problem when using swarms that have both TCP and uTP connections. If nothing is done, uTP connections would often be starved out for bandwidth by the TCP connections. This mode is called "Prefer TCP" in qBittorrent. The "Peer proportional" mode on the other hand, simply looks at the current throughput and rate limits all TCP connections to their proportional share based on how many of the connections are TCP. This works best if uTP connections are not rate limited by the global rate limiter.
* '''Allow multiple connections from the same IP address''' — determines if connections from the same IP address as existing onnections should be rejected or not.  This option is disabled by default to prevent abusive behavior by peers.  It may be useful to allow such connections in cases where simulations are run on the same machine, and all peers in a swarm has the same IP address.
* '''Enable embedded tracker''' — ''TBA''
* '''Embedded tracker port''' — ''TBA''
* '''Upload slots behavior''' — ''TBA''
* '''Upload choking algorithm''' — specifies which algorithm to use to determine which peers to unchoke.
* '''Strict super seeding''' — activate libtorrent's strict mode for super seeding ("when this is set to true, a piece has to have been forwarded to a third peer before another one is handed out. This is the traditional definition of super seeding.").
* '''Always announce to all trackers in a tier''' — controls how multi tracker torrents are treated.  If this is set to true, all trackers in the same tier are announced to in parallel. Otherwise the behavior is as defined by the multi tracker specification.
* '''IP Address to report to trackers''' — is the ip address passed along to trackers.  If this value is blank, the parameter will be omitted.
